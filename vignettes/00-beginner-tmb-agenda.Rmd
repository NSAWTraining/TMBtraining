## Training Description

Template Model Builder (TMB) is a statistical computing platform that performs maximum likelihood inference and is easily extended to include random effects. Models are written in C++ and run with R using the TMB R package. This course will cover how to write a TMB model and call and run it from R. 
<br>


**Prerequisites**: Attendees will need R and an R IDE installed on their local machine. The TMB R package (>1.8.0) also needs to be installed from CRAN. Please see [Getting Started with TMB](https://nsawtraining.github.io/TMBtraining/articles/00_01_Getting_Started.html) for software requirements and TMB package installation instructions. The [TMB Developer Resources](https://nsawtraining.github.io/TMBtraining/articles/00_00_TMB_Developer_Resources.html) provide a collection of useful resources from the TMB developers.
